What is it?

backupNexpose.pl is a little script to do automatic backups from the nexpose's web gui. You can simply add the script at crontab and you will have scheduled backups.

I write this script because nexpose web gui does not have any tool to do this.

getNexposeReports.pl is a little script do get reports from web gui.

Note: In both scripts, you have edit the file and put your own nexpose's information such as login, pass, nexpose's address...
